Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Motivation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The University of Applied Sciences Central Hessen (THM
\begin_inset CommandInset nomenclature
LatexCommand nomenclature
symbol "THM"
description "University of Applied Sciences Central Hessen"

\end_inset

) is a decentralized and department oriented institution with campuses in
 the cities of Gie√üen, Friedberg and Wetzlar.
 This decentralized view often leads to inefficient or uncertain usage of
 shared resources
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Students and teachers want to go to lessons.
 Facility Management want maximal room usage.
 The IT Department wants security.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Scheduling at the THM is done by each department on its own under the auspices
 of room assignments from Facility Management.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Why is the theme important? Who is it important to?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Resource Management
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Resource management in more general terms can be defined in similar terms
 to the four basic functions of persistent data storage: creation, reading,
 updating, and deletion of resources (CRUD
\begin_inset CommandInset nomenclature
LatexCommand nomenclature
symbol "CRUD"
description "Creation, Reading, Updating, and Deletion"

\end_inset

).
 Resource managment is a very broad topic and as applies to schools or,
 more specifically, colleges or univerities has three perspectives that
 make up the bigger picture: facility management, human resource management
 and quality management (certification).
 Each perspective brings with it its own resources and emphasis in usage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These four activities take on different aspects dependant upon the resource
 upon which they are applied and are known under differing names.
 For example, creation in terms of material objects is generally refered
 to as aquisition, whereas in terms of personel as hiring.
 Reading in terms of documentation is self explaining, but in terms of other
 resources it could be seen as the browsing of a telephone book, or performing
 cost calculations in a spreadsheet program.
 Updating would be the refurbishment of a room, the further education of
 an employee, or the modification of documentation among other things.
 Deletion could be the simple removal of software, or the demolition of
 a building.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As can be gleaned from the previous examples resource managment in the broadest
 sense encompasses such topics as human resources management, facility managemen
t, document management and many other fields at the level of the university
 level.
 Resource management within this thesis will focus mainly on the topic of
 scheduling.
 This aspect is unique in that it has in and of itself has no resources
 per se and takes place at a high level of abstraction.
 It is an association of resources aquired through other resource management
 processes.
 Its resources are lessons, events, appointments, meetings, speeches, etc.;
 they tell us who does what, when, where, for whom, and under certain circumstan
ces it even gives us a glimpse as to how.

\begin_layout Section
Methodology
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This work focuses primarily on the scheduling aspect of resource management.
 Specifically, it focuses on the resources involved in its scheduling aspect.
 It examines the important attributes and dependencies of these resources,
 and it examines the interaction and integration of the systems which manage
 them individually.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While this thesis does not concern itself directly with the problems of
 human resources, facility managment, university documentation, or any other
 aspect of resource management, it does mention them often either directly
 or tangentelly.
 This is unavoidable due to the associative nature of scheduling which binds
 resources of these different aspects to create new resource types.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However the crux of this work is the integration of some of the various
 resource management systems which are responsible for the resources used
 in the scheduling process.
 These systems and the workflows which are responsible for the management
 of their data will be a central point of this work.
 To implement this integration RESTful

\end_inset

 web services have been used as the means of information exchange.
 To this end this work will address RESTful web services, ignoring the SOAP

 implementation completely.

\begin_layout Standard
To aid understanding of the terms presented and their representation in
 the accompanying figures, where necessary the original German terms often
 follow their English translations and appear in <<
\shape italic
doubled pointed braces
\shape default
>>.
 In a few cases two terms refer to the same concept or attribute within
 Untis.
 In these cases, the more often used term is used within this work.
 However where another term is used for the same concept the term will then
 appear in (
\shape italic
round parenthesis
\shape default
) behind the word.

\begin_layout Section
Overview of the Thesis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The resources dealt with in school scheduling software and Untis scheduling
 software in particular have been handled up until this point by multiple
 systems; even within the same organizational structure for the same resources.
 Each of the systems and administrative processes for resource management
 have their own taxonomy and required information to model the resource
 both within the system and in every day speech.
 Three tasks emerge for the implementation of a system based upon the resources
 which provide the material for chapters two, three and four.
 These have strong dependancies between one another and often reveal themselves
 to be cyclic in their development.
 However in order to maintain some semblance of structure they have been
 encapsulated as much as possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Chapter two will define and model resources.
 It will also codify their attributes and dependencies.
 These items have an extremely strong coupling with the systems designed
 to represent them.
 In order to present the results of the thesis in a more understandable
 manner, the resour?ces, attributes and dependancies will be presented as
 they have evinced themselves, based upon the system topology, instead of
 trying to confront the reader with various stages of incremental resource
 models.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Chapter three will examine the currently used resource management systems
 and the workflows responsible for its supply of data.
 The results of this examination not only have an effect in the implementation
 of system in terms of architecture, but also in terms of how resources
 are modeled, what their required attributes are, and what dependencies
 exist.
 Where system limitations in resource handling exist, strategies for compensatin
g for discrepensies and missing resources will be discussed.
 Where resource attributes are unique to specific systems, they will be
 emphasized and their taxonomy and nature will be discussed in the context
 of their usage.
 It will also discuss, where applicable, system specific factors such as
 access control mechanisms, concurrency and workflow distribution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Chapter four will examine dependencies between the existing resource management
 systems.
 These dependencies, in combination with various workflows for resource
 management, crystalize into the system architecture implemented within
 the framework of this thesis and give clues as to possible future extensions
 and interfaces to other resource management systems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lastly chapter five will provide a summary of the resource management systems
 and processes.
 It will summarize some of the key advantages and deficits of the existing
 systems and workflows and the steps to harness, improve or circumvent them.
