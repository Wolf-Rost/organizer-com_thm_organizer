\begin_layout Chapter
Scheduling Resources
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Scheduling is in principle an association of teachers, rooms, the subjects
 which are to be taught, and the times at which lesson content should be
 taught, resulting in a set of lessons.
 Although this is a bit simplistic it provides us with a good starting point
 for the more abstract resources which result as consequences of the association
s of these objects.
 In this chapter the administrative, basic, organizational and temporal
 resources, and the associations necessary for scheduling will be examined.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A detailed description will be given of each of these objects.
 Then extrapolating from this description we will take a look at some of
 its more important attributes.
 This will give us a somewhat more precise look at the subject of each section
 and its relation to other previously discussed objects within the chapter.
 We will then use this perspective to understand how the previously described
 object definitions were modeled using the resource objects available in
 the Untis 2013 software.
 Examining the functionality of the equivalence, and potential benifits
 and drawbacks of these design decisions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the first section we will take a brief look at administrative resources
 used to organize schedules.
 Then we will examine the basic resources of teachers, rooms and subjects.
 Organizational resources and attributes will then be explained.
 The concept of time in regard to lessons and lesson groups will be explored
 including resulting resources and the consequences of temporal modeling.
 Finally the lessons themselves will be introduced binding all of these
 elements together into a consistent whole.

\begin_layout Standard
When a user opens Untis 2013 using the multiuser the first things he will
 be confronted with are the login dialogue and the resources associated
 with it.
 These resources, 'school', 'school year' and version, are largely administrativ
e resources and exist solely to restrict the amount of information available
 for schedule coordinators to the amount directly necessary to the scheduling
 process and to uniquely identify the schedules they have created.

Departments
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Untis schools correspond to THM departments.
 Departments are semi-autonomous organizational units at the THM, and as
 such are responsible for their own scholastic scheduling.
 Unlike other resources departments are a self containing entity which posess
 or share other resources.
 All resources are dependent upon them for definition and value.
 In the real world as well as within the Untis program, they exist as an
 administrative tool to ease the complexity of the scheduling process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a tool there is little that can be said about them, for, in effect, they
 allow for specific user interactions and a define roles in the workflow
 of the scheduling process.
 As such they will recieve much more attention in the next chapter Distributed
 Planning and System Integration 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vpageref

 where workflows and the system security concept will be elaborated upon.

Modeling
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While Untis does have a department resource that can have a partially similar
 workflow to that of a Untis school, the resource time restrictions and
 planning priorites associated with the individual departments could not
 be modeled using this resource within Untis.
 For this reason, it was the recommended that the departments of the THM
 use Untis schools to implement the actual departments of the THM./*source*/
 This recommendation was used and the Untis school administrative tool is
 capable of modeling all the above mentioned attributes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As stated above, the ability for departments to compete for resource availabilit
y as discussed 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vpageref
reference "Time Restrictions and Planning Priorities"

\end_inset

 was the deciding factor in chosing to use Untis schools as opposed to Untis
 departments.
 Untis schools could perform this action, whereas Untis departments could
 not.
 The converse action, that of departments managing shared resources, is
 however supported for Untis departments and not for Untis schools.
 This can add administrative overhead if the schedule coordinators do not
 have the necessary priveledges to modify each others data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The decision to use Untis schools instead of Untis departments did however
 make planning conflicts more visible as resource usage became visible for
 the first time without schedule coordinators having to exchange information
 via telephone or e-mail.
 This under the caveat that the lesson producing the conflict had already
 been planned.
 It also allowed the department managed resources to be restricted to the
 amount of resources actually relevant to the planning in the respective
 department.
 If the departments had been modeled as Untis departments every room in
 the THM would have had to have been directly accessable for every department
 because they would have all been a part of the same Untis school.

\begin_layout Standard
Unfortunately the Untis 'school year' is defined only by its name, and,
 in turn, only serves to name a group of schedules.
 The 'school year' stands in no causal relation to the actual dates of the
 school year used within the schedule which are input using a completely
 different user interface.
 It also stands without causal relation to any subordinate planning period.
 This resource is completely unusable for its intended purpose is however
 required to create schedules with, and for this reason they cannot be ignored.
 However Untis does provide resources for the creation of actual school
 years and planning periods.
 These resources are discussed in Planning Periods

Untis versions are completely independent working copies of a schedule that
 can stand without any actual relation to others of the same school and
 school year.
 This deviates sharply from that of the American Heritage dictionary which
 defines a version as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

A particular form or variation of an earlier or original type...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Although it is not guaranteed, inspected or directly supported Untis assumes
 that this definition is carried out through exporting, opening and saving
 of a previous version as a new version.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The lack of direct Untis support of versioning and revision control is one
 of the challenges of the integration in the practical accompaniment to
 this thesis.
 At the THM the actions of revision control implemented are functions of

Teachers are persons hired by the responsible bodies to convey the knowledge

 Because of teacher's complexity as human beings, their description here
 solely encompasses that which is necessary to model them as resources for
 scheduling at the THM.
 Teachers are identified within resource management systems at the THM by
 means of a 'hg' number, because of it's enforced uniqueness and brevity
 in comparison to the teacher's name.
 This consists either of the letters 'hg' or four letters taken from the
 first and last names followed by an integer value.

\begin_layout Standard
Untis offers the resource teacher which are capable of modeling all required
 attributes and Teachers were relatively easy to model in Untis.
 Untis teachers additionally have place for attributes such as title, contact
 information, gender, birth date, values for cost calculation, and much
 more.
 The fields attribute can even be modeled in a special field which helps
 Untis optimize schedules.

\begin_layout Standard
The simple teacher dialogue is displayed in figure 2.3 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vpageref
reference "fig:Teachers-View"

\end_inset

.
 This dialogue shows how the required attributes with exception of departments
 have been modeled onto attributes available to Untis.
 While fields like first and last name fields are self explanatory, and
 the personel number field can easily be explained as holding the teacher's
 'hg' number.
 Other fields such as name (short name), external name, and description
 need a bit more explaination.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The name, or short name, is an Untis internal, human-readable key.
 This key can be used in multiple Untis dialogues for faster input of resources.
 In many cases the dialogue will require the use of the name whereas a select
 few will also allow the use of the long name, in this case last name, for
 data input.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The external name is a name which is used to denote resources used by multiple
 departments.
 This name is uniquely identifiable amongs all departments and it has been
 strongly recommended that the external name be the same as the short name./*sour
ce*/ Teachers are a problem in this area as often details such as first
 names and 'hg' numbers are often unknown and must be collected.The THM 'hg'
 number is, from the standpoint of its content, the best attribute to use
 for this value.
 However, they are very often human unreadable and when inputting data the
 schedule coordinators would have to cross-reference them with a list, which
 made this choice very unapplealing.
 The other choice which would have provided a suitable solution would have
 been the use of first and last names.
 This solution has two larger problems.
 The first is that first names are often unknown to the differing schedule
 coordinators, much the same as the 'hg' number.
 The second is the amount of information the coordinator would need to input
 in order to get a valid result in the event of identical last names, namely
 at least the complete length of the last name.
 A further problem with external resources is propogation, this will however
 be discussed in detail in Data Propogation

\begin_layout Standard
The Untis description field holds the reference to the teacher's field or

 There is a Untis field which is actually designed to hold teacher fields,
 however there are multiple problems with modeling the data in this manner
 as will later be described in the subsection Fields and Competence Centers

Lastly as described in the section Departments 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

, the departments had to be modeled using the Untis school resource, leaving
 this attribute without equivalent within the teacher objects.

In figure 2.4

\end_inset

 we again see the Untis fields name(short name) and external name.
 With rooms as well as every resource other than teachers we also see the
 field long name.
 As with teachers the name and external names are unique, human-readable
 keys, with the name being for department internal use, with the external
 name for interdepartmental use.
 The long name is an additional name that had been until recently the same
 name used for the name field.
 However at the THM there was some discrepency between the name used in
 resource management systems and that which they actually have on the physical
 rooms.
 For this reason the long names of rooms in two of the THM buildings have
 been used to record this discrepency and the long name is used for external
 data output.
 This discrepancy also had the advantage that the name could also be slightly
 modified from the THM standard of <building>.<floor>.<room> in this case
 with one less period which is less typing when inputting room names and
 makes some of the names short enough to be completely displayed in the
 Units selection boxes.
 One of which can be seen in the upper left corner of the figure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both the building and the floor attribute are not available in Untis.
 The THM, as stated in the last previously stated, has it's own standardized
 coding of room names.
 This allows for the storage of both of these values in the name.
 However this has two disadvantages.
 Firstly some names are too long to be displayed in most Untis selection
 boxes without manual adjustment to their size.
 Secondly when filtering for the rooms of a particular building or floor,
 schedule coordinators are confronted with rudimentary regular expressions
 while using the Untis filter system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The room type could be relatively comfortably input into the room's description
 field.
 More on room types 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vpageref

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The room equipment was modeled using the Untis statistics field.
 This allowed for the comma seperated input of single character abbreviations
 for room equipment similar to the way in which the same information was
 previously stored within the Excel sheets of FM.
 The only real disadvantage of modeling the information in this was is that
 statistic codes are not manageable resources in Untis.
 Statistic codes cannot be associated with and actual text fields which
 would then be readable to tell other information systems that 'B' stands
 for video projector ('Beamer' in German).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The capacity is a standard room attribute in Untis and was easily modeled.

\begin_layout Subsection
Subjects
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The American Heritage Dictionary defines a subject as 'A course or area
 of study...'.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "AHDSubject"

\end_inset

 Sadly most other defintions are every bit as vague or self refering.
 In this work a subject will be defined as a thematic subset of a field
 of knowledge.
 Subjects are highly codified at the THM to meet the standards of the accreditin
g institutions.
 Because of this they have a great many attributes.
 In the description only the subject number, effort, preliminary work and
 proof of proficiency will be discussed as their explanations are to cumbersome
 to fit comfortably in the attributes table.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The subject number is a brief interdepartmental identifier.
 The formatting of the subject number varies greatly between departments
 at the THM.
 MNI for example uses two letters which describe the subject field, a number
 indicating the niveau of complexity, and three further numbers.
 KMUB by contrast uses a five digit integer value.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The effort is the value in credit point of the course.
 At the THM one credit point corresponds roughly to 30 hours of effort on
 the part of the student, with 10 hours being time spent physically in the
 subject's lessons and 20 hours individual effort.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The preliminary work is the work which the student must complete to be able
 to complete the course.
 This is typically a set number of written homework units, but could be
 many things such as attendence of a certain amount of lesson units, or
 a team project.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The proof of proficiency is the way in which students should demonstrate
 their mastery of the subject's themes.
 While typically an examination this can be many things such as a paper,
 a software project, or a speech.

The modeling of subjects in Untis is somewhat rudimentary, restricted almost
 to the bare minimum of that which is required for the scheduling process.
 As seen in figure 2.5 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vpageref
reference "fig:Subjects-View"

\end_inset

 the modeled attributes had to be restricted to four.
 The name and long name have a special place within the THM as often times
 the name as seen here is the colloquial name more often used, with the
 long name being the official name of the subject.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unlike teachers and rooms the field external name does not exist for this
 resource.
 This reflects Untis design decision to implement interschool resources
 as competing instead of sharing.
 In any account often subjects and the teachers responsible for them are
 shared between departments.
 Biology for example is tught by the same teachers for both the department
 MNI and KMUB.
 Almost every subject department SuK teaches is shared with another department.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The subject number is a unique identifier within a department's curriculum
 catalogue.
 Although differing in format in betweenn departments it is currently used
 to retrieve information from the LSF information system which has been
 modified to accept all of the attribues listed above and many more.
 This number would in principle make the optimal inter-departmental identifier
 for this subject which although the same themes and information are presented
 may have differing names in different departments.

In previous versions of Untis the type of resource could be selected from
 a drop down box.
 However if no resource was associated with the description the resource
 type to be described would be expunged.
 In the current version of Untis, associating a description with a resource
 can only occur when while editing a resource of a particular type the descripti
on is typed in or selected.
 This is somewhat inefficient as it requires that either the description
 itself is not created from the descriptions dialogue, but dynamically from
 the dialogue of the resource to be described, or that the description is
 created in the description dialogue and then that the schedule coordinator
 types it in exactly as if he was dynamically creating it.

Room types are general categorizations of rooms according to their intended
 purpose.
 The rooms of the THM are roughly grouped into eight different main categories
 and over 40 subcategories.
 Each main category is associated with a letter and each subcategory extends
 this with a single number.
 For example a lecture hall with a capacity range of 131 to 185 students
 has the code A8 within the FM systems.
 A workshop for electronics has the coding W5.

Modeling
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Modeling room types in Untis occurs in the two methods mentioned in the
 previous subsection on Descriptions.
 They are either created through the descriptions interface or dynamically
 by just typing them into the descriptions field.
 This has the same two disadvantages mentioned in Descriptions, that the
 data created dynamically is incomplete and that unassociated descriptions
 will not be recognized as describing rooms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to identify room types as such both within and without Untis, the
 Untis Statistics field was used to hold the letter 'r'.
 Within Untis, this enables schedule coordinators to use the Untis filter
 tool to sort out any descriptions which do not have an 'r' in the statistics
 column so as to make sure the list of room descriptions is complete and
 correct.
 Outside of Untis it allows for the presorting of export data into it's
 correct types.

Lesson Types
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The way in which the learning goals of a particular lesson are to be reached
 is in no small way influenced by the typical methods of instruction.
 The instructors at the THM typically make use of one of five subject types:
 lectures, exercises, practical training, seminar, or small group work.
 These lesson types are by no means exclusive and are often used in tandem
 to provide the student with more 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lectures are the most common lesson type consisting of a mostly frontal
 speech by the lesson teacher and most often feedback from students to themes
 of that speech.
 Lectures exist to convey knowledge which should be reflected upon by the
 student.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Exercises serve primarily to help students to reflect upon conveyed theoretical
 knowledge through repetition.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Placement or practical training serves to strengthen the students grasp
 of practical knowledge via hands-on learning.
 Typically placement has the completion of one or more projects as a goal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Seminar as held at the THM is a course in which students are given the assignmen
t to research and strengthen their knowledge about a particular theme or
 interest.
 The students then hold presentations at regular intervals to discuss the
 results of their efforts.

Fields and Competence Centers
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "Fields and Competence Centers"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Teachers by means of their education and experiences have certain particular
 fields of knowledge in which they excel.
 These fields logically mirror the fields whose themes they, the teachers,
 are should teach to students.
 These themes and their practical and logical implications form the material
 from which subjects are created.
 At the THM, it has been suggested to codify these fields to use them to
 build subject identifiers.
 As examples the abbreviation 'WIR-ING' could refer to economic engineering,
 'NAT-INF' for information science having to do with natural sciences, or
 'BAU' to denote a field having to do with architecture or construction
 science.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Often times these fields also directly correlate to departmental competence
 centers which help to develop the curriculum for a course of studies.
 The teachers which work in these disciplines discuss amongst themselves
 contemporary themes and how best to introduce these themes into those presented
 within the lessons in order to assure quality and relevance.

Modeling
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Modeling Fields as descriptions in Untis has the exact same weaknesses as
 with room and subject types.
 However Untis does have a unique tool to handle fields directly in the
 case of subjects, and indirectly in the case of teachers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Subjects can be aggregated to a set number of names.
 All of the subjects which pertain to a particualar field can then be aggregated
 to a name which corresponds to their field.
 Not only that, they could also be aggregated to their level of complexity.
 The lessons which are normally taught within the first couple three semesters
 of the six semester bachelor degree program could be aggregated to 'Basic',
 or the courses of the master degree programs to 'Master'.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The problem with this solution is similar to the problem with associating
 Untis descriptions to resource types.
 In order for tachers to be associated to these fields or levels of complexity,
 they musr first already be scheduled to teach them.
 Untis then calculates backwards from these existing lessons to the fields
 and complexity levels which the teacher is able to teach.
 Worse yet, this information is not available in the teacher interface shown
 in Teachers 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vpageref
reference "Teachers"

\end_inset

.
 It is only visible in a particular tab of the expanded teacher overview.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The distict advantage of this second method is that Untis can recognize
 on hand of this footnoted information where the school actually needs to
 hire more teachers to help to cover the amount of lessons for these fields.
 Its schedule optimization program recognizes the rareness of these teachers'
 knowledge and plans these teachers into the rarer subject fields first.

Subject pools and Courses of Study
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Subject pools at the THM are a group of subjects gathered together for organizat
ional purposes based upon a many distinct criteria.
 In scheduling it is preffered to plan subject pools so that as few lessons
 as possible take place at the same time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The largest subject pools are a mirror of the accredited course of studies
 (CoS
\begin_inset CommandInset nomenclature
LatexCommand nomenclature
symbol "CoS"
description "Course of Studies"

\end_inset

) required for a particular degree.
 Which is to say every student which wishes to achieve a particular degree
 needs to complete a certain subset of the courses available within the
 CoS for his particular degree.
 These subject pools are seldom directly planned because of their large
 and unwieldy nature.
 When planned this subject pool will usually indicate an incomplete set
 where the missing subjects are either unknown or performed by an external
 organization.
 As an example of an incomplete set, Department MNI frequently has to plan
 other departments lessons into rooms for which it is responsible.
 Rather than research the information to correctly input the set, the person
 responsible often created placeholders representing the unknown subjects
 and teachers to both reserve the resources while planning and to prevent
 others from planning into room reservations.
 As an example of a largely externally conducted set, Department KMUB has
 a Biomechanics, Motor Activity and Movement Analysis CoS which is conducted
 jointly with the Justus-Liebig University in Giessen.
 Because of KMUB's annual planning cycle, large amounts of subjects can
 be seasonally omitted.
 The result of the externally held subjects by Justus-Liebig University
 and subject omission is a set of only five subjects, which can easily be
 planned and displayed.
 Within the subjects required from one degree program to another there may
 be significant overlapping, however all other subject pools are subsets
 of the courses available for one particular degree program.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first noteworthy criteria for one such subset subject pool is the current
 semester of the student.
 In the Most degree programs recommend subjects to be completed in a particular
 order in order that the knowledge necessary for successful learning in
 one particular subject has been hopefully taught to the student already
 in a course taken in a previously.
 This subsetting seeks to ensure a consequent and sequential acquisition
 of knowledge while the student progresses toward his particular degree.
 This criteria is the most often used for subset creation.
 Due to planning restrictions causing some departments to only offer subjects
 annually, this subsetting can be extremely important to students and their
 responsible department planning coordinators.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second criteria is thematic or preferential.
 Students may often times choose between multiple electives or between thematic
 subject pools, i.e.
 majors.
 Often there are several electives from which the student can openly choose
 a certain number, often these are grouped together for a better overview.
 In the case of thematic subject pools students are usually required to
 choose a certain number of subjects to complete out of a much smaller pool
 to strengthen knowledge in one particular field of study.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The last criteria for subsetting is quality assurance.
 Often large numbers of students can be a detriment to learning via hands-on
 activities, or certain subjects are designed to be taught through work
 performed in relatively small groups.
 This can result in a qualitative division of students into smaller more
 manageable learning units.
 An example would be Department MNI's first semester bachelor students.
 In all four bachelor programs offered by Department MNI students are required
 to complete the course Object Oriented Programming.
 Because of the hands-on nature of the material to be taught and the large
 amount of students over different lessons are being offered for this subject.
 Another example would be the load splitting perofrmed by Department KMUB.
 Several courses for a particular semester are delivered to the full load
 of students, however other the students are broken down into several smaller
 groups to visit other courses where such large numbers of students would
 be impracticable.
 In effect they form a subdivision of the students for a particular semester.

Identity Firstly subject pools must be uniquely identifiable.
 This identity must take into account all of the subset criteria mentioned
 in the resource introduction, the hierarchy of sets to which it belongs,
 and CoS namespaces.
 As an example of a CoS namespace, the Information Science CoS exists for
 both a bachelor and master degree, in order to be able to identify the
 correct CoS by name the degree upon completion must also be a part of that
 name.

Criteria With the exception of subject pools which directly correlate to
 CoSs, all subject pools have a superior subject pool of whose subjects

 should plays an important role.

The biggest change the introduction of Untis 2013 brought into the system
 landscape at the THM was the change from a 'two dimensional' weekly plan
 to a 'three dimensional' weekly plan in which the lessons offered could
 be different from one week to the next.
 In the two dimensional plan weekly variance was highlighted through commentary
 to individual lessons in the three dimensional plan this variance from
 week to week was could be correctly modeled using temporal and organizational
 resources previously unavailable.

Planning Periods

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the THM there are two planning periods per year the winter semester and
 summer semester.
 Semesters are defined not only according to the times in which standard
 lessons occur, but also include the range of dates until the next semester
 begins.
 This has the effect of making the summer semester somewhat longer than
 the winter semester.
 Within the semesters, cyclic lessons, block lessons and exams are planned.
 The length of these two planning periods can vary between departments as
 each has can plan an individual cycle of lectures and exams.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The third planning period which deserves mention is the academic year encompassi
ng these two semesters.
 As some lessons or subject pools are only offered in one semester annually,
 the academic year has often to be taken into consideration to confirm that
 the offering of subjects is in line with the guidelines created when the
 subject's CoS was certified.
 The planning period for the acedemic year is usually similar to the length
 of an actual year, however dependent upon the individual scheduling needs
 there can be a shortfall or overlappage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Semesters are identified by the season in which the semester ends and the

\begin_layout Standard
Both semesters and the academic year were implemented as the Untis resource
 'Period', not to be confused with the in Untis nameless daily periods discussed
 in the next subsection.
 Untis periods require both identity and length, are disjunct planning periods,
 and are hierarchically structured which makes them an almost optimal resource
 for modeling semesters.
 The only point point of friction between the optimal model and the Untis
 model is that the Untis model limits the academic year to the length of
 a normal year.

Lesson Periods (Blocks)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lesson periods or blocks are units of time in which lessons can be slotted
 to occur.
 At the THM periods have three typical forms dependent upon the context
 of the week in which they take place.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Standard lesson periods take place during most of the semester.
 These are 90 minutes in length with 15 to 20 minute breaks between them
 and an hour planned for lunch.
 Depending upon the department and CoS these range from 30 to 33 in number.
 Six periods can take place Monday through Friday with three possibly taking
 place on Saturday.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Exams take place three weeks per semester.
 Examination periods are two hours in length and have no scheduled breaks.
 However finals are no longer than 90 minutes in length allowing students
 and teachers 30 minutes free time in between exams.
 Such periods are 25 in number with five taking place per day Monday through
 Friday.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally block lessons take place in breaks in standard lesson scheduling
 and take place for certain range of days from morning into the afternoon.
 These times are however set by the instructor of the block lesson and cannot
 yet be defined in the exact manner of the other two daily periods.

\begin_layout Standard
The schedule coordinator inputs the number of days upon which lessons occur
 and the number of lessons per day.
 This creates a grid of with a number of blocks corresponding to the days
 times the number of blocks.
 This rule-of-thumb handling at the THM leads to three ficticious lesson
 periods occurring Saturday afternoon.
 The schedule coordinator further sets upon which day the school week begins
 and with what integer value the numbering of lesson periods should begin.
 Lesson period start and end times must then be individually entered for
 each block.
 Lesson periods can also be marked as occuring during the morning or afternoon.
 The entry of morning or afternoon can effect the planning priorities dialogue
 for teachers and subject pools.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the 'Multiple Time Grid' Untis extension module, multiple grids of
 lesson periods can be created.
 This multi-grid would have been able to directly address the lesson period
 needs for exams and block lessons, however there are three differences
 between the Untis implementation and the expectations of the scheduling
 coordinators which make the use of the multi-grid problematic.
 First the use of differing lesson period plans at the THM occurs only along
 the lines of predetermined calendar weeks, in Untis once multiple grids
 have been created they run theoretically parallel to one another.
 Secondly the choice of which lessons can be assigned using which grid occurs
 by assigning grids to subject pools.
 At the THM the same subject pools use both lesson period plans dependant
 upon the type of lessons being offered in the given week.
 Finally when the use of multi-grid is enabled the Untis lesson output is
 no longer displayed along the crisp lines of defined lesson periods, instead
 Untis schedule output graphic approximations of the lesson period run against
 a range of hours.
 While not a showstopper the non-explicit association of lessons to times
 is comparatively vague and could lead to confusion among students.

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Time resctrictions and preferences are not a resource per se, they are more
 of a department specific perspective of the availability of teachers and
 rooms.
 Although in principle restrictions and preferences are neither the same
 in meaning or importance, they can have a similar effect on the development
 of a working schedule and are implemented in Untis according to the same
 program tool.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Minisec
Time Restrictions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Time restrictions have the most impact upon scheduling.
 Time restrictions are the consequence of resource reservations.
 These restrictions can effect teachers and rooms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the THM departments are allotted a certain set of rooms.
 However certain room types, most specifically large lecture halls, are
 few enough in number that their availability for each individual department
 must be discussed and planned in advance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This discussion occurs between the department scheduling coordinators and
 FM.
 Schedule coordinators calculate on hand the expected number of students
 and the courses held in front of large numbers of students then number
 of lesson periods they need in rooms.
 They then discuss the assignment of rooms for specific lesson periods and
 in the end each department leaves the discussion with a set number of available
 lesson periods which will hopefully cover his planning needs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once the assignment has been made schedule coordinators go about the actual
 business of scheduling.
 This is an iterative process where, in order to attempt optimal room usage,
 schedule coordinators try to fit a lesson in the smallest room available
 to them which will fit the expected number of students.
 Should none of the rooms in the first selection be available, they try
 to schedule the lessons in the next larger room type.
 In the end should the coordinator be unable to plan the lesson he then
 requests unused assigned slots from other departments.
 Once an agreement has been made the schedule coordinator plans the lesson
 and informs FM about the change to the room availability assignment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The availability of teachers is a less complex process.
 Teachers know for the most part when they have obligations during the work
 week and inform the schedule coordinators.
 The schedule coordinator then attempts to schedule lessons held by that
 teacher so as not to impinge upon those obligations.
 Should this not be possible the coordinator discusses the situation with
 the teacher, should no direct solution evince itself the teacher with the
 scheduling conflict may then be exchanged with one available for the time
 in which the lesson must occur.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Minisec
Planning Priorities
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Planning priorities like time restrictions can affect teachers, rooms and
 subject pools.
 Teacher planning priorities are optional notations as to when the teacher
 prefers to hold his lessons, or would rather not hold them.
 Planning priorities as applied to rooms or subject pools allow the schedule
 coordinator to guide high and low volume scheduling times.

Untis Modeling

\begin_layout Standard
Untis allows for planning priorities for rooms, teachers, subjects and subject
 periods.
 However instead of being related to the departments resource available
 within the Untis software, they are related to the 'school' administrative
 tool.
 This has had dramatic reprecussions for the further scheduling process
 as previously stated in the section on Departments 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Untis allows the lesson periods for resources to be given signed integer
 values ranging from -3 to 3.
 These values can be interpreted from the implementation as 'absolutely
 do not plan here' for the -3 value up until 'plan here if at all possible'
 for the 3 value.
 While the assignment of values is handled the same for all values, the
 -3 value has a blocking value when using any planning dialogue, fulfilling
 the need for the THM time restrictions.

\begin_layout Standard
The example above displays the planning priorities of one of the teachers
 at the THM.
 As we can see in the illustration there are multiple ways to assign planning
 priorites by lesson period, weekday, mornings, or evenings.
 Entering a value in a larger block of time overwrites the subordinate units
 of time.
 In this example the teacher prefers to hold his lessons mornings and has
 for these lesson periods the value two.
 The teacher also has obligations which prevent him from teaching Tuesday
 and Wednesday afternoons for which the value -3 has been recorded.
 Additionally the his department does not schedule lessons on Saturdays
 so he also has a restriction recorded for that day.
 The Untis developers suggest that whenever possible to use an aggregate
 such as day, morning, or afternoon to assign planning priorites to lesson
 units for performance reasons.

As seen in the example graphic above rooms and subjects have a more rudimentary
 mask for the recording of planning priority values than that for teachers
 and subject pools.
 As regards rooms, this entry mask fits very well with the workflow of the
 planners at the THM.
 Rooms which are not shared in between departments are unrestricted for
 the responsible department.
 Rooms which are shared are assigned for specific lesson periods and typically
 not by any lesson period aggregate.

Temporal Behavior
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Often times lessons will occur with a certain amount of weekly periodicity,
 that is to say a certain lesson may occur in intervals with number of weeks
 as multipliers.
 For example if a lesson could only be held every second week it would be
 said to have a weekly periodicity.
 It is also concievable that a certain few lessons may occur over several
 weeks starting or ending abruptly within the otherwise ordinary run of
 a semester.
 In Untis these behaviors are called 'lesson groups'.
 They model this sort of temporal lesson behaviour for a single lesson or
 group of lessons and form a seperate type of lesson categorization.
